  Disconnects the host's Stripe account.

  Performs three steps in order so attendees cannot complete payment after
  the account is gone:

    1. Collect pending booking_payments for this host (no lock needed).
    2. Expire each open Stripe Checkout Session (HTTP calls, outside any
       DB transaction to avoid holding the connection open).
    3. Atomic transaction: mark each booking_payment as `failed` (conditional
       UPDATE — only when `status = 'pending'`, so a concurrent
       `checkout.session.completed` webhook that has already moved the row to
       `paid` is not overwritten), transition the linked `awaiting_payment`
       meeting to `expired`, then soft-delete the connect_account row.

  Returns `{:ok, %{cancelled_count: n, outstanding_refunds_count: m}}` on
  success, `{:error, reason}` if the transaction fails.

  ## Outstanding refunds

  `outstanding_refunds_count` is measured before the soft delete and is not
  acted on: these are cancelled bookings whose money the host still holds, and
  disconnecting neither settles nor cancels them. It is reported because the
  disconnect is the moment the host loses the ability to issue them from
  Tymeslot (from here on only their Stripe dashboard can settle them), so the
  caller can say so rather than let the obligation disappear quietly.

  ## Race with checkout.session.completed

  The conditional `UPDATE … WHERE status = 'pending'` in step 3 means a
  `checkout.session.completed` webhook that has already flipped a row to `paid`
  will not be overwritten — the update silently skips that row, and
  `cancelled_count` reflects only the rows that were actually cancelled.

  If the webhook arrives *after* step 3 sets the meeting to `expired`, the
  `CheckoutSessionCompleted.ensure_awaiting_payment/1` guard will find the
  meeting in `expired` status and return `:no_op`, leaving the payment untouched.

  ## Stripe session expiry failures

  Stripe session expiry is best-effort. If a call fails (network error, session
  already expired/completed) we log and continue — the meeting and booking_payment
  are cancelled locally regardless, so the attendee cannot complete the booking
  even if the Stripe session is still technically open.

  ## Paid meeting types are left alone

  Deliberately: `payment_required` and `price_cents` survive a disconnect so a
  host who reconnects gets their prices back instead of re-entering every one.
  The form no longer clears them by omission
  (`Tymeslot.MeetingTypes.FormMapper.build_attrs/2`), the changeset no longer
  fails unrelated saves over the stored flag
  (`MeetingTypeSchema.validate_payment_fields/2`), and `Bookings.Create`
  refuses a paid booking outright while charges are off, so nothing is taken
  in the meantime. Clearing them here, as `MeetingPayments.change_default_currency/2`
  does for a currency change, would destroy that state for the far more common
  case of a temporary disconnect.

  Reconciles a local `connect_accounts` row against a Stripe account snapshot.

  `account` is the Stripe account object (`charges_enabled`, `payouts_enabled`,
  `requirements.disabled_reason`, …). `event_at` is when that snapshot was
  emitted, used purely for the out-of-order guard against `last_account_event_at`.

  Callers must supply `event_at` from the right source. For `account.updated`
  webhooks it is the **event envelope's** `created` (the event emission time) —
  never the account object's own `created`, which is the account-creation
  timestamp and is identical across every event, so keying ordering off it
  would drop every update after the first. A direct account retrieve (resync)
  has no envelope and stamps the current time, since it reflects Stripe's
  current truth as of the fetch.
