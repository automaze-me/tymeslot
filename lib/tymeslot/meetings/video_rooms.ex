defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.VideoRooms do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles video room integration for meetings.

  This module is responsible for:
  - Adding video rooms to existing meetings
  - Creating secure join URLs for organizers and participants, and the
    identity-free one a booking's guests share (`guest_join_url/1`)
  - Managing video room lifecycle and expiration
  - Coordinating with video providers (MiroTalk, Meet, Teams, etc.)

  Video rooms can be added after a meeting is created, typically by an async worker.

  ## Transaction boundaries

  The external HTTP call to the video provider is made **outside** any database
  transaction. Only the final "attach the generated room to the meeting" write is
  wrapped in a short transaction that re-locks the meeting row and re-checks the
  idempotency condition, so that a concurrent worker that already attached a room
  is detected and the second caller receives `{:ok, meeting}` without a duplicate
  provider call affecting the database. This prevents a slow video provider from
  holding a database connection for the duration of the remote request.

  Adds a secure video room to an existing meeting.

  This function:
  1. Retrieves the meeting (no transaction) and checks idempotency
  2. Verifies the organizer has video integration enabled (no transaction)
  3. Creates a video room via the configured provider (no transaction — external HTTP)
  4. Generates secure join URLs for organizer and participant (no transaction)
  5. Inside a short transaction: re-locks the meeting, re-checks idempotency,
     and persists the video room attributes
  6. Schedules a calendar event update

  ## Parameters
    - meeting_id: The ID of the meeting to add a video room to

  ## Returns
    - {:ok, meeting} on success with video room attached
    - {:ok, meeting} if the meeting already has a room attached (idempotent)
    - {:error, :meeting_not_found} if meeting doesn't exist
    - {:error, :organizer_not_found} if organizer lookup fails
    - {:error, :video_disabled} if video provider is set to "none"
    - {:error, :video_integration_missing} if no video integration configured
    - {:error, :video_integration_inactive} if integration is disabled
    - {:error, :unknown_provider} if provider is unsupported
    - {:error, :incomplete_video_room} if the provider returned a room carrying
      neither a room id nor a meeting URL
    - {:error, :join_url_unavailable} if the provider could not mint a join URL
      and the room carries no usable URL to fall back on
    - {:error, :database_update_failed} if the final write fails
    - {:error, reason} on other failures

  Builds a meeting's join URLs again for a new start time, when its provider's
  join URLs stop working some time after the time they were built for.

  Meant for a reschedule: the result is merged into the same write that moves
  the meeting, so every reader of `organizer_video_url` and
  `attendee_video_url` downstream (the reschedule emails, calendar sync,
  webhook deliveries, reminders) sees links valid for the new time. The room
  itself is left alone: `video_room_id` and `meeting_url` are never part of
  the result, and the provider is never asked for a new room.

  Returns `%{organizer_video_url: url, attendee_video_url: url}` when the links
  were rebuilt, and `%{}` when there is nothing to rebuild or rebuilding
  failed, in which case the stored links are kept. It never raises: a failure
  here must not stand in the way of the reschedule itself.

  Only providers declaring time-bound join URLs are rebuilt (see
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.ProviderBehaviour`'s
  `time_bound_join_urls?/1`), which also keeps providers whose join URLs need
  a network call out of this inline path. A meeting without a room, or whose
  integration is gone or inactive, is skipped without logging, as room
  creation skips it.

  Unlike `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoSyncWorker`, this deliberately does not fall
  back to another integration for the same provider through
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.IntegrationResolver`. A reconnected Jitsi
  integration may point at a different server or hold a different secret, so
  tokens signed with it for the old room would be wrong; skipping keeps the
  stored links instead.

  The join URL for a recipient of this booking that has no personal link:
  its guests, whom the booker invited and who own neither
  `organizer_video_url` nor `attendee_video_url`.

  Built at send time rather than stored. The two per-role links are columns
  on the meeting and a booking has any number of guests, so there is no
  column a guest's link could live in; it is also the one link that is the
  same for every guest, since it names none of them.

  Answers the meeting's own room URL for every provider whose join links are
  plain room addresses, which is what its guests already received, and a
  room-scoped, non-moderator token link on a provider that signs its links
  (see
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.ProviderBehaviour.shared_join_url/2`).
  A booking with no room answers `nil`.

  It never raises and never fails. A confirmation has to go out whatever the
  video integration is doing, so anything short of a link falls back to the
  room URL, as the provider itself does when minting fails.
