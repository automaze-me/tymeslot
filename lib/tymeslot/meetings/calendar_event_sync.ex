defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.CalendarEventSync do
  @moduledoc """
  Domain orchestration for synchronising meeting calendar events with the
  configured calendar provider (CalDAV, Google, Outlook).

  This module owns the *what* of calendar synchronisation — the create, update
  and delete flows, including:

  - the create→update fallback when a meeting already carries a provider mapping,
  - the update→create-on-404 recovery,
  - persistence of the resulting provider UID / event-id mapping back onto the
    meeting (via `Tymeslot.Meetings.MeetingQueries`),
  - sending an error notification to the calendar owner on persistent create
    failures.

  Each entry point returns a tagged tuple that the calling Oban worker
  (`Tymeslot.Workers.CalendarEventWorker`) maps to a retry/error outcome:

    * `:ok`
    * `{:error, error_type}` — an error category the worker classifies for retry
    * `{:discard, reason}` — the operation can never succeed

  The worker owns the *when* (Oban dispatch, timeouts, backoff, retry
  classification); this module owns the *what*. Persistence always flows through
  the relevant query module — no raw `Repo.*` writes live here.
