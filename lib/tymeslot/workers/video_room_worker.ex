defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoomWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Creates the video room for a confirmed meeting, in the background.

  Room creation is deliberately off the booking path: the booking is already
  confirmed by the time this runs, so a slow or failing video provider delays a
  join link rather than a booking. That trade makes the retry behaviour the
  interesting part of this worker, and it is split across two collaborators:

  - `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoom.ErrorPolicy` decides what a given failure means
    for the job: wait it out, or stop trying.
  - `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoom.Recovery` takes over once ordinary retries are
    spent, pacing the remaining attempts against the moment the attendees
    actually need the link and announcing the booking without one meanwhile.

  When the caller asks for `announce`, it has deferred the whole
  `meeting_created` event to this job rather than only its emails, so that every
  notification carries the join link. This job is therefore what raises that
  event for any booking with a video room.

  What is left here is the job itself: fetch the meeting, run the call under a
  timeout, and report the outcome.

  How long the job waits for room creation on `meeting`, in milliseconds.

  Longer than the network budget its video integration's provider declares,
  so the job only stops waiting on a call its own request timeouts have failed
  to end. Giving up any sooner would abandon a room the provider may already
  have created, and the retry would create another that no booking records.
  Waiting on the provider the meeting actually uses, rather than the slowest
  of all, keeps a slow provider from holding the queue for every other one.

  The meeting is read for those two fields alone, so a `MeetingSchema` and a
  bare map of them are both accepted. `%{a: t}` in a spec is a map with
  exactly that key, which a schema struct never is, hence the open map here.
