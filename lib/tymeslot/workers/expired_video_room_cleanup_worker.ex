defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.ExpiredVideoRoomCleanupWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Daily clean-up of video rooms that outlive their meeting.

  Some providers keep a booking's room on the organiser's own server until
  something deletes it: a Nextcloud Talk conversation otherwise stays in the
  organiser's Talk list for ever. `ProviderConfig.rooms_deleted_after_meeting/0`
  names those providers. This scan deletes each such room once its meeting
  ended more than the retention period ago (`VIDEO_ROOM_RETENTION_DAYS`,
  7 by default), which leaves time for a follow-up in the same conversation.

  Deleting is handed to `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoSyncWorker`, which resolves the
  integration, retries a transient failure, treats a room already gone as done
  and clears `video_room_id` on success. That last step is what makes the scan
  converge: a meeting still carrying a room id is still outstanding.

  Mirrors `Tymeslot.Workers.OrphanedVideoRoomScanWorker`, which does the same
  for cancelled meetings, so this scan leaves those to it. Rooms whose
  integration is waiting to be reconnected are skipped until it is.

  Rooms made for events on the dashboard calendar grid have no meeting, so
  they are read from their own records (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms`)
  and deleted through the same job, which removes each record once its room is
  gone. The same retention, look-back window and skips apply. Their recorded
  end can be stale, because the event may have been moved in a calendar
  client, so each is checked against the calendar before it is queued, and
  again by the job before it deletes.
