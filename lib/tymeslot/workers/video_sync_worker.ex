defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.VideoSyncWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker that syncs a meeting's provider-side video room (e.g. Zoom) after
  the booking changes.

  Reschedule and cancellation must update or delete the scheduled meeting on the
  video provider so its start time/duration stay in step with the booking and so
  cancelled meetings don't linger in the organiser's account. The provider call
  is a network request that can fail transiently (Zoom 5xx/429), so — like
  calendar sync — it runs here through Oban with retries rather than inline as a
  single best-effort attempt.

  Providers without a server-side meeting object (Google Meet, Teams, MiroTalk,
  Custom) resolve to `:ok` immediately, so enqueuing for them is a cheap no-op.

  The meeting is re-read on every attempt so the provider always receives the
  current times — never stale args captured at enqueue time. A meeting that no
  longer carries a video room (or vanished entirely) is treated as already
  synced and the job is discarded.

  The same sync serves the rooms of events created on the dashboard calendar
  grid, which no meeting holds. Those are recorded by
  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms` and enqueued with
  `enqueue_event_room/2`; a delete removes the record once the room is gone.
  Such a room's integration is resolved as a meeting's is, from its recorded
  provider when the link is gone. An `"expire"` job asks the calendar again
  whether the event is really over before deleting
  (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.check_event_video_room_expired/1`), since the event
  may have moved in between.
